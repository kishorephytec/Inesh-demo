/*
 * Timer module backed by a single timerfd. A sorted list of timers is
 * maintained and the timerfd is always set to expire at the shortest timeout.
 *
 * Timer updates occur by calling timer_process() when the timer_fd() is ready,
 * which is typically queried using select() or poll().
 *
 * To use a timer, set timer.callback and call one of the timer_start_xxx()
 * functions. Timer structures are typically included as a member of a bigger
 * structure, which can be retrieved using container_of() when timer.callback()
 * is invoked.
 *
 * Timers are generally used in different independent modules, which each have
 * their own context. Retrieving the module context from the struct timer is not
 * always possible using container_of(), typically when the module has a list
 * of entries with each their own timer. To handle this issue, modules must
 * register themselves with timer_group_init(), which allows to retrieve module
 * context using container_of() on the struct timer_group from the callback.
 * A default timer group can be used by passing group as NULL for modules that
 * do not need this feature.
 *
 * Periodic timers can be implemented by explicitly calling timer_start_rel()
 * from the callback function, but for convenience timer.period_ms provides an
 * automatic restart mechanism when set.
 *
 * Timers may be dynamically allocated, but they MUST be stopped before being
 * freed. Timers can even be freed from their callback functions (eg. lifetime
 * timers).
